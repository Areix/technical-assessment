# Areix Technical Assessment

# Tasks

- [Frontend Development](frontend)
- [Backend Development](backend)
- [Programming](programming)

# Notes
- This assessment is to assess if the candidate(s) are technically capable of AREIX AI and application development, and further identify the best-fit of job matrix and pathway for the qualified candidates. There is only one technical assessment. 
- You are highly recommended to complete at least 2 tasks.
- You are required to create a github repo to contain your work.
- You are required to write your README as if it was for a production service. Include the following items:
    - Description of the problem and solution.
    - Clearly clarifing the assessments you choose to conduct.
    - Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural.
    - Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project (future improvement).
    - Formulating an efficient plan where and how to host your application OR Link to the hosted application where applicable.
- You will be highly considered if you could use the API endpoints which you have built in the backend assessment and impletement into the frontend assessment. 
- You will be highly considered if you could successfully complete all the 3 assessments. 
- Once you complete your work, please send your repo link to our email hellohk@areix-ai.com

# How we review
Your application will be reviewed by one or more of our engineers. We value quality over feature-completeness. It is fine to skip certain features aside provided you mention them out in your project's README.

The aspects of your code we will assess include:

- **Architecture**: how clean is the separation between the front-end and the back-end?
- **Technical choices**: do choices of libraries, databases, architecture etc. seem appropriate for the chosen application?
- **UX**: is the app interface understandable and pleasing to use? Is the API intuitive?
- **Correctness**: does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
- **Code quality**: is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable? Are there any code smells or other red flags? Does object-oriented code follows principles such as the single responsibility principle? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?
- **Security**: are there any obvious vulnerability?
- **Production-readiness**: does the code include monitoring(optional)? logging? proper error handling?
