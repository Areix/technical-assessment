# How we review
Your application will be reviewed by one or more of our engineers. We value quality over feature-completeness. It is fine to skip certain features aside provided you mention them out in your project's README.

The aspects of your code we will assess include:

- **Architecture**: how clean is the separation between the front-end and the back-end?
- **Correctness**: does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
- **Code quality**: is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable? Are there any code smells or other red flags? Does object-oriented code follows principles such as the single responsibility principle? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?
- **Security**: are there any obvious vulnerability?
- **UX**: is the app interface understandable and pleasing to use? Is the API intuitive?
- **Technical choices**: do choices of libraries, databases, architecture etc. seem appropriate for the chosen application?
- **Production-readiness**: does the code include monitoring(optional)? logging? proper error handling?
